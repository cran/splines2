Description: A complementary package on splines providing functions
    constructing B-splines, integral of B-splines, monotone splines
    (M-splines) and its integral (I-splines), convex splines (C-splines),
    and their derivatives of given order. Piecewise constant basis is
    allowed for B-spline and M-spline basis.
