\title{I-Spline Basis for Polynomial Splines or its derivatives}
\usage{
iSpline(x, df = NULL, knots = NULL, degree = 3L, intercept = FALSE,
        Boundary.knots = range(x, na.rm = TRUE), derivs = 0L, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The predictor variable.  Missing values are allowed and will be
returned as they were.}

\item{df}{Degrees of freedom.  One can specify \code{df} rather than
\code{knots}, then the function chooses "df - degree" (minus one if
there is an intercept) knots at suitable quantiles of \code{x} (which
will ignore missing values).  The default, \code{NULL}, corresponds to
no inner knots, i.e., "degree - intercept".}

\item{knots}{The internal breakpoints that define the spline.  The default
is \code{NULL}, which results in a basis for ordinary polynomial
regression.  Typical values are the mean or median for one knot,
quantiles for more knots.  See also \code{Boundary.knots}.}

\item{degree}{Non-negative integer degree of the piecewise polynomial. The
default value is 3 for cubic splines. Note that the degree of I-spline
is defined to be the degree of the associated M-spline instead of actual
polynomial degree. In other words, I-spline basis of degree 2 is defined
as the integral of associated M-spline basis of degree 2.}

\item{intercept}{If \code{TRUE}, an intercept is included in the basis;
Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{Boundary.knots}{Boundary points at which to anchor the I-spline basis.
By default, they are the range of the non-\code{NA} data.  If both
\code{knots} and \code{Boundary.knots} are supplied, the basis
parameters do not depend on \code{x}. Data can extend beyond
\code{Boundary.knots}.}

\item{derivs}{A non-negative integer specifying the order of derivatives of
I-splines.}

\item{...}{Optional arguments for future usage.}
}
\value{
A matrix of dimension \code{length(x)} by
\code{df = degree + length(knots)} (plus on if intercept is included).
Attributes that correspond to the arguments specified are returned
for usage of other functions in this package.
}
\description{
This function generates the I-spline (integral of M-spline) basis matrix for
a polynomial spline or its derivatives of given order..
}
\details{
It is an implementation of the close form I-spline basis based on the
recursion formula of B-spline basis.  Internally, it calls
\code{\link{mSpline}} and \code{\link{bSpline}}, and generates a basis
matrix for representing the family of piecewise polynomials and their
corresponding integrals with the specified interior knots and degree,
evaluated at the values of \code{x}.

\examples{
## Example given in the reference paper by Ramsay (1988)
library(splines2)
x <- seq.int(0, 1, by = 0.01)
knots <- c(0.3, 0.5, 0.6)
isMat <- iSpline(x, knots = knots, degree = 2, intercept = TRUE)

library(graphics)
matplot(x, isMat, type = "l", ylab = "I-spline basis")
abline(v = knots, lty = 2, col = "gray")

## the derivative of I-splines is M-spline
msMat1 <- iSpline(x, knots = knots, degree = 2, derivs = 1)
msMat2 <- mSpline(x, knots = knots, degree = 2)
stopifnot(all.equal(msMat1, msMat2))
